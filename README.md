# To do

## Meta
 - [x] Initial MVP commit
 - [ ] Make a nice `README.md` file.
 - [ ] Add an import sorter
 - [ ] Organize CSS better (remove inline styles, maybe)

## Features
 - [ ] Always start with at least one person and one item
 - [ ] Diagonal name labels
 - [ ] Improve UI, add nice title, etc
 - [ ] Align buttons
 - [ ] Get delete person working properly (esp. when deleted name takes the place of someone elses)
   - Perhaps: Adding name doesn't change checkboxes, but deleting a name resets iff there are checkboxes?
 - [ ] Get delete item working properly
 - [ ] Get duplicate working
 - [ ] Color coding of some kind
 - [ ] Get "tab to continue making the form" working
 - [ ] Get tab movement working properly
 - [ ] Enforce name uniqueness (since this is the key identifier
 - [ ] Add a clear button
 - [ ] Add cookie functionality to prevent accidental reloads from screwing things up (how long lasting?)
 - [ ] Convert `shouldUpdate` into more efficient `dependencies` or "update-if-these-fields-change" function
 - [ ] Type "any" things


## Testing
 - [ ] Set up Cypress tests




# Assorted notes

 - Focusing on desktop first (mobile later, if ever)
